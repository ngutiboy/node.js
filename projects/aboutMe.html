                                division II club during my prime. At my leisure time, I watch sports, particularly soccer. I love fishing as well. I am an indoor person. I spend most of my time studying and playing with my kids . They are my treasure.
                                Enrolling in this bootcamp was a great challange but i was determine to seek a new career that i so much love. I am willing to relocate if i find a better job opportunity in any location, provided it's as safe as Overland
