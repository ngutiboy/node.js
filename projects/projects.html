                    <p>Fitbit is a fitness add-on app that will push you to go an "extra" mile with your workout!
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Through any wearable fitness trackers, people can workout "On their own time." With Step2Goal or the fitbit app, users can achieve their daily step goal without altering their daily life routines.
                        For Example - if someone needs a gallon of milk or needs a few things from CVS or Walgreens, This app will allow
                        the user to choose the walking routes to that specified location to meet their step goal.
                    </p> <br>
                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>Step2Goal connects with the Fitbit API (which is supported by ALL Smartphones) and extracts data such has your current step goal, Your current steps taken and the distance. Step2Goal reaches out to the Google Maps API to acquire your
                        current location. Once we have your location.  We plug that information into FourSquare API. With the FourSquare API, we are able to generate and display nearby locations that you can go that will help you achieve your step goals</p>
