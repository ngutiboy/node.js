                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>The user enters the game by entering their name, and then waits for a second player to join the game. Until a second player joins, the user or the first player will have to wait. Once the second player joins the game, both players
                        can now play and communicate through an interface.</p>

                        <h3>How It Works</h3>
                        <p>This App matches friends based on the user's responses to ten survey questions. The value of these survey questions ranges from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Once completed and submitted, an existing closest match
                            record based on the lowest absolute difference to the ten questions is returned. Friend Finder is a simulation of a dating app. The application is implemented using a Node.js and Express server on the back end and the Materialize
                            CSS framework on the front end. Demo This App is deployed to Heroku. Please check it out here.</p>

                        <h3>How It Works</h3>
                        <p>This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

                                The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.</p>

                            values of each crystal.

                        <p>This application implements a simple command line based storefront using the npm inquirer package and the MySQL database backend together with the npm mysql package. The application presents two interfaces: customer and manager.

                                MySQL Database Setup
                                In order to run this application, you should have the MySQL database already set up on your machine. If you don't, visit the MySQL installation page to install the version you need for your operating system. Once you have MySQL isntalled, you will be able to create the Bamazon database and the products table with the SQL code found in Bamazon.sql. Run this code inside your MySQL client like Sequel Pro to populate the database, then you will be ready to proceed with running the Bamazon customer and manager interfaces.
                                
                                Customer Interface
                                The customer interface allows the user to view the current inventory of store items: item IDs, descriptions, department in which the item is located and price. The user is then able to purchase one of the existing items by entering the item ID and the desired quantity. If the selected quantity is currently in stock, the user's order is fulfilled, displaying the total purchase price and updating the store database. If the desired quantity is not available, the user is prompted to modify their order.</p>
